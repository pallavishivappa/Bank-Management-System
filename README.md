# Bank-Management-System
This Java banking program creates accounts with random numbers and passwords, lets users log in, deposit, withdraw, display balance, and transfer money with OTP verification. It uses an interface for standard operations, getters/setters for private fields, and Scanner/Random for input and random generation.
